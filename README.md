# Codechef-Ranklist-Scrapping
Download code cc.py
This is just for top 1000 rank on codechef. This is working in my pc because they are showing 500 ranks per page. You check yours. You need to install selenium, chromedriver, python3 to run this code.
Just update your rank in your rank variable and calculate len(set(final)). It will give output a number of istinct institute before your rank.
Please be careful about path you are putting for your chromedriver.
install Chromedriver.exe, selenium using pip.
